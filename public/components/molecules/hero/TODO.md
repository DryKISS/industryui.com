# Todo

- [ ] Should render the Children through a loop - i.e. the Dog image
  - [ ] Columns should run as kinda slots, where the content shape is not defined as much
- [ ] Allow this to go full width - currently in a container
- [ ] Think about internal layouts that can be defined for this perhaps
- [ ] Seperator should be optional, changeable and out of here - maybe just the SVG path can be defined?
- [ ] Add more stories

##Â Done
