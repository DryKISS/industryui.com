        Brazil Soccer Name was a small fun Facebook application created in a very short time to
        really amplify the conversions we wanted on Love Football.

      <p>
        It was very successful with tens of thousands of downloads, and many thousands of social
        interactions such as shares and likes.

        Prince of Persia: The Sand of Time, is a blockbuster movie starring Jake Gyllenhaal.
        Disney wanted to use Facebook to market the film in various locations. UK, Italy,
        Germany etc.
      </p>

      <p>
        It was decided to create a page for each country so the content could be
        internationalied and localised for each.
      </p>

      <p>
        This proved exceptionally problematic in terms of getting sign off for each change
        required from one country to another, but we managed to deliver all pages on time.
      </p>

      <p>
        Facebook at this time also had issues in terms of testing whole pages. So extra effort
        was needed to set this all up.
