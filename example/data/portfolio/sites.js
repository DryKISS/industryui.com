      <p>
        Beep Taxi was a revolutionary automated taxi ordering system. Created in 2005 it
        included most of the mechanics we now see on Uber or Hailo. However the smartphone was
        not in existence then!
      </p>
      <p>
        At its basic level it matched client to taxi through various means including; mobile
        triangulation; postcode voice recognition and GPS if available. It would then match the
        nearest driver and route the call directly to their hands free mobile.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beep was all about putting the user in control. Providing safety options such as call
        recording and constant taxi tracking. Beep would simply take 1 per journey.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unfortunately due to lack of funding Beep Taxi was closed in 2007; it's a shame to think
        that Britain could have had a billion dollar business like Uber in 2005, if back then we
        had the investment mentality like in the US.
      </p>
      <p>
        DryKISS as a partner, were tasked with the technical architecture and development of
        this complex system.
      </p>
      <p>
        Firstly we needed to track the Taxi, to do this a custom GPS / GSM device was
        manufactured and installed in over 100 test taxis in Reading. A basic toggle switch
        alerted the system of the vehicle's availability. Each was also fitted with a SIM to
        provide the location data we required.
      </p>
      <p>
        To locate the client we crafted an IVR platform that provided all the options the user
        would need to book a taxi. If they called on a mobile phone we would instantly locate
        them; a land line, prompted the IVR to ask for a postcode through voice recognition.
        Additional prompts asked if they wanted the taxi now or in the future. Culminating in
        the call being routed to the nearest available Beep driver, to give reassurance of
        pick-up time and location.
      </p>
      <p>
        An after journey rating system was created by sending the user an SMS, they simply
        needed to reply with a 1-5 score.
      </p>
      <p>
        Lastly a complex back office and API platform was developed to handle all the IVR
        information; GPS data from the taxis and order routing. Algorithms processed the best
        taxi for the user based on distance, ratings and journey time. A full reporting engine
        gave the business the transparency of best drivers, popular pick up areas and advocate
        customers. Also the means to invoice and track payments from drivers.

      <p>
        After enjoying one of the best Thai massages I have ever had in the UK; I confronted the
        owner Ling. Stating that her overall web presence could be improved, especially in terms
        of SEO and social marketing. Unfortunately the business didn't have a Facebook or Google
        business page and the SEO was non-existent, barely ranking
      </p>

      <p>
        Having launched CodeBlender we also wanted to put this library into practice on a
        commercial website. Quite confident that DryKISS could help this local business owner at
        least achieve some positive SEO gains.
      </p>

      <h3>Business Understanding</h3>
      <p>
        We arranged several meetings with Ling over the next few weeks to understand where the
        business currently was, understanding hers', the staff and client√®le's pain points.
      </p>

      <h3>Pain Points</h3>
      <p>A little web technology understanding.</p>
      <p>Had very little knowledge of SEO, social pages and Google SERPs.</p>
      <p>Had overspent on previous web-site and didn't want to make the same mistakes.</p>
      <p>Mixed messaging on what the business did.</p>
      <p>
        Memberships, promotions and loyalty cards were great but poorly conveyed and sometimes
        overlapped.
      </p>
      <p>Customer's all had very positive feedback about the services.</p>
      <p>Design and wording of marketing material was inconsistent.</p>
      <p>No company orientated email address.</p>
      <p>Current site was not responsive.</p>
      <p>
        It was originally set up in the Chinese model of a membership only spa and massage, but
        the owners quickly realised that this probably would not work in the UK.
      </p>

      <h3>Goal</h3>
      <p>
        Before we embarked on any new site development, we wanted to investigate the pain points
        and find solutions for as much of these as possible.
      </p>
      <p>Make GreenTouchPI the top Thai massage establishment on Google within 6 months.</p>
      <p>Setup social pages; Facebook, Wahanda, now Treatwell, Google Business Page.</p>
      <p>Establish a routine of social posting, and promotion schedule.</p>
      <p>Create a site that was responsive, fast and met Google's latest checklist.</p>
      <p>Simple contact and booking form.</p>

      <h3>Competitor Analysis</h3>
      <p>
        DryKISS conducted a thorough competitive analysis of the 10 or so local massage
        establishments in the area.
      </p>
      <p>
        Investigating the Social and SEO strategies and potential keywords and phrases they were
        targeting. Also looking at services, pricing and promotional activities.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outcome of this was that it was entirely possible to create a SEO strategy that could
        compete if not outstrip these competitors.
      </p>

      <h3>Keyword Research</h3>
      <p>
        DryKISS drafted a thorough report on the phrases used by local residents around massage
        services. We identified many keywords, terms and phrases we should look at incorporating
        on all messaging the organisation sends out.
      </p>

      <h3>Development</h3>
      <p>
        A small budget was put in place to carry out this transformation. It meant that we could
        not utilise the usual DryKISS design process.
      </p>
      <p>
        We opted to use a generic Bootstrap styled site, to inherently give us a responsive
        design, it therefore meant we could rapidly build pages and focus resource and budget on
        the digital marketing aspect of the plan.

        In one view the service allows a user to search for a chemical term, returning data from
        several external APIs to create a concise data sheet. Returned synonyms can then be
        utilised in further searches; allowing the user to discover more obscure patents.
      </p>
      <p>
        MineSoft is one of the most prominent Patent information and search companies in the
        world. They have created and maintain several key browser based software tools; used by
        thousands of lawyers, patent specialists and organisations daily.
      </p>
      <p>
        MineSoft approached DryKISS to create an addon to their most popular service PatBase.
        They required a tool that allowed users to search for similar words, compounds, genes or
        translations.
      </p>
      <p>The product would go on to be called "Patbase Thesaurus"</p>

      <h3>Goal</h3>
      <p>
        Allow users to discover words that they may have not known before, all of these entries
        could then be added to a string to search the PatBase database of Patents.
      </p>
      <p>It would mean that patents using obscure wording could be discovered by the users.</p>

      <h3>Deliverables</h3>
      <p>Create a tool that is easy to use for current PatBase users.</p>
      <p>Full browser compatibility.</p>
      <p>UI Translated into several languages including Chinese.</p>
      <p>Ability to browse back to a previous search.</p>
      <p>Shopping basket word saving.</p>
      <p>Words translated into a PatBase query.</p>

      <h3>Development</h3>
      <p>
        In a forty day window we worked through several different providers of chemical, gene
        and synonym data. Landing on WikiPedia, WIPO and ToxNet to provide the relevant data.
      </p>
      <p>
        Built a simplistic UI structure straight from Bootstrap, that fitted the current design
        requirements of PatBase.
      </p>

      <h3>Some nice features include:</h3>
      <p>Able to browse backwards and forwards and maintain the searches undertaken</p>
      <p>Shopping basket style add words to query functions</p>
      <p>Copy to clipboard</p>
      <p>Each result could be clicked to research on that, creating a mining pattern</p>
